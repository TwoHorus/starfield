# Starfield in Rust

For Compiling on linux, you might need to install additional packages. For me, the following helped:

``sudo apt install libalsaplayer-dev libudev-dev libasound2-dev``

# Compiling and running the project
Cargo will go a long way in helping you here. It should be a simple ```cargo run```. Tests (``cargo test``) will also run, currently there are no tests implemented.
