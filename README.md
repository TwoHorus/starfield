# Learning on a foreign project
I was interested in Rust and cloned a Project, that was not maintained. There was no documentation of
what the program should do or if it ever did something. When I started, it was failing at Compilation.

For Compiling on linux, you might need to install additional packages. For me, the following helped:

sudo apt install libalsaplayer-dev libudev-dev libasound2-dev
